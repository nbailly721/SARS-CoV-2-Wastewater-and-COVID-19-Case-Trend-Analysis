-This project processes and visualizes SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentration data and COVID-19 case counts for the Toronto region. 
The analysis uses R to clean, standardize, and visualize weekly and daily trends in 2024, enabling comparison between wastewater viral
signals and reported infection rates.

##üñ•Ô∏è Workflow Overview

Data Import and Cleaning (R Script)

Load raw datasets: COVID-19 weekly case counts, daily wastewater concentration, and weekly aggregated wastewater data.

Standardize date formats across datasets.

Filter datasets to include only 2024 records and relevant geographic areas (Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area).

Select relevant columns and remove missing values to ensure clean, consistent datasets for downstream analysis.

Data Visualization and Trend Comparison (R Script)

Generate individual line plots for:

Daily SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the GTA.

Weekly SARS-CoV-2 concentration in Toronto.

Weekly COVID-19 case rates in Toronto.

Normalize and combine wastewater and case data to visualize co-trends over time.

Plot both metrics on the same graph to explore temporal associations.

##üìÅ Dataset

cases.xlsx: Weekly COVID-19 case counts in Toronto (source: https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/Data-and-Analysis/Infectious-Disease/Respiratory-Virus-Tool).

surveillance.xlsx: Daily SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations for the GTA (source: https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/Data-and-Analysis/Infectious-Disease/COVID-19-Data-Surveillance/Wastewater).

aggregate.csv: Weekly aggregated SARS-CoV-2 concentrations across Ontario (source: https://health-infobase.canada.ca/wastewater/).

##üîß Tools & Packages

R Environment:

Language: R

Packages:

tidyverse (data manipulation, plotting)

readxl (Excel import)

dplyr (data wrangling)

##üìä Key Results

Line plots of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations over time in both daily (GTA) and weekly (Toronto) formats.

Line plot of weekly COVID-19 case rates in Toronto.

Combined normalized trend graph comparing COVID-19 case rates and wastewater viral load in 2024.

##üìÇ Files

wastewater_covid_analysis.R: R script for importing, cleaning, filtering, normalizing, and visualizing the datasets.

cases.xlsx: COVID-19 case data file.

surveillance.xlsx: Daily wastewater SARS-CoV-2 data file.

aggregate.csv: Weekly provincial wastewater dataset (filtered for city-level analysis).

##üß† Notes

Wastewater viral concentrations are standardized and log-transformed at the site level, and should be interpreted as relative indices, not raw viral copies per mL.

The combined trend plot uses min-max normalization to enable visual comparison between wastewater signals and case rates.

This project focuses on Toronto (2024 only) to examine whether wastewater-based surveillance reflects reported COVID-19 case trends over time.
